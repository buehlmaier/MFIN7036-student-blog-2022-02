This blog is written by students at the University of Hong Kong
(HKU). It serves two purposes: First, to document students'
reflections about their learning progress. Second, to showcase some of
the results students have obtained as part of their projects.

The topics of the blog posts are about text analytics and natural
language processing (NLP) in finance and fintech. At any rate, keep in
mind that this blog is "work in progress." The blog will be updated
throughout the course as new blog posts become available.
